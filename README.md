# Fun Games

This repository contains a C++ program that offers three fun games for users to play. The games included are:

1. **Number Guessing Game**: In this game, the user has to guess a number between 1 and 100. The user gets three chances to guess the number correctly.
If the user fails to guess the number in three attempts, they lose the game.

3. **Tic Tac Toe Game**: This is a classic game of Tic Tac Toe. Two players can play this game. The players take turns to mark 'X' and 'O' on a 3x3 grid.
The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game.

5. **Palindrome Checker Game**: In this game, the user enters a string, and the program checks if the string is a palindrome. A palindrome is a word,
phrase, number, or other sequences of characters that reads the same forward and backward, ignoring spaces, punctuation, and capitalization.
